# Parametric Models
## Outliers
```class_type = "outliers" ```  
outliers are sampled from the 2D space (x_r) X (y_r),
where x_r (x range) is the closed interval of values x can take and 
y_r (y range) is the closed interval of values y can take.
```
"outliers": {
                "x_r": (-2.5, 2.5),
                "y_r": (-2.5, 2.5)
    },
```

## Conics

### Circles
```class_type = "circles"```  
circles are generated by uniformly sampling a center and a radius from the closed intervals specified by the user.  
the default values are:  
```
"circles": {
       "radius_r": (0.5, 1.5),
       "x_center_r": (-1.0, 1.0),
       "y_center_r": (-1.0, 1.0),
},
```

### Lines
```class_type = "lines"```  
lines are generated by randomly sampling two points in the 2D space (x_r) x (y_r) (in order to define slope and intercept) 
and consequently sampling points belonging to such line.  
each point of the line is assured to belong to the 2D space (x_r) x (y_r).
```
"lines": {
            "x_r": (-2.5, 2.5),
            "y_r": (-2.5, 2.5)
},
```

### Ellipses
```class_type = "ellipses"```  
ellipses are generated by uniformly sampling a center and a radius from the closed intervals specified by the user, and 
consequently apply a horizontal stretch/shrinkage to the sampled circle.  
the default values are:  
```
    "ellipses": {
                "radius_r": (0.5, 1.5),
                "x_center_r": (-1, 1),
                "y_center_r": (-1, 1),
                "width_r": (0.1, 1),
                "height_r": (0.1, 1)
    },
```

### Any Conics
```class_type = "conics"```    
randomly samples models from the classes specified above.     
hyperbola is not implemented yet.
